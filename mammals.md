# Mammalian XY Sex Determination

## Overview
In mammals, sex determination is governed by the XY chromosomal system. Individuals with an **XY** chromosome pair develop as males, while those with **XX** develop as females. The presence of the **SRY** gene on the Y chromosome acts as a genetic switch that initiates the male developmental pathway.

## Key Genetic Players

### SRY (Sex‑Determining Region Y)
- Located on the short arm of the Y chromosome.
- Encodes a transcription factor that binds to DNA and activates a cascade of male‑specific genes.
- **Function:** SRY is the **testis‑determining factor (TDF)**. It up‑regulates *SOX9* expression, which drives the differentiation of the bipotential gonad into a testis.

### SOX9
- A transcription factor belonging to the SOX (SRY‑related HMG‑box) family.
- Under normal XY development, SRY triggers high‑level expression of SOX9 in the supporting cell lineage of the gonadal ridge.
- **Role:** SOX9 maintains its own expression and promotes the formation of **Sertoli cells**, the organizing center of the testis.

## Hormonal Control of Sexual Differentiation

Once a testis is formed, it secretes two critical hormones that direct the development of male internal and external genitalia.

### 1. Anti‑Müllerian Hormone (AMH) / Müllerian‑Inhibiting Substance (MIS)
- Produced by Sertoli cells of the fetal testis.
- **Action:** Causes regression of the **Müllerian ducts**, which would otherwise give rise to the female reproductive tract (oviducts, uterus, upper vagina).

### 2. Testosterone
- Synthesized by **Leydig cells** of the fetal testis.
- **Action:** 
  - **Local effect:** Stabilizes the **Wolffian ducts**, which differentiate into the male internal genitalia (epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles).
  - **Systemic effect:** Converted to **dihydrotestosterone (DHT)** by 5α‑reductase in peripheral tissues. DHT is responsible for masculinization of the external genitalia (penis, scrotum).

## Default Female Pathway
In the absence of SRY (i.e., XX individuals), the bipotential gonad develops into an ovary. Without testicular hormones:
- The Müllerian ducts persist and form the female reproductive tract.
- The Wolffian ducts regress due to lack of testosterone.
- External genitalia differentiate into the clitoris, labia, and vaginal opening.

## Summary Table

| Component | Role in Male Development | Role in Female Development |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **SRY**   | Initiates testis formation | Absent; ovary development |
| **SOX9**  | Maintains Sertoli cells; testis organization | Expressed at low levels; ovarian somatic cells |
| **AMH/MIS** | Regresses Müllerian ducts | Not produced; Müllerian ducts persist |
| **Testosterone** | Stabilizes Wolffian ducts; masculinizes external genitalia | Low levels; Wolffian ducts regress |
