# Comparative Sex Determination Mechanisms

A collaborative digital repository documenting and comparing the genetic and hormonal mechanisms of sex determination across three distinct vertebrate classes:

1. **Mammals** (XY system)
2. **Birds** (ZW system)
3. **Reptiles** (Temperature‑Dependent Sex Determination, TSD)

## Project Goal

This repository serves as a structured educational resource focusing on the key genes (e.g., *SRY*, *DMRT1*), hormones (androgens, Müllerian‑inhibiting substance), and environmental factors involved in each system.

## Documentation Index

- [Mammalian XY Sex Determination](mammals.md) – SRY gene, SOX9, androgens, MIS.
- [Avian ZW Sex Determination](birds.md) – DMRT1 gene, dosage effects.
- [Reptilian Temperature‑Dependent Sex Determination (TSD)](reptiles.md) – temperature‑sensitive aromatase, estrogen modulation.
