# Avian ZW Sex Determination

## Overview
Birds (and many other non‑mammalian vertebrates) use a **ZW** chromosomal system that is the reverse of the mammalian XY system. In birds:
- **Females** are the **heterogametic sex** (ZW chromosomes).
- **Males** are the **homogametic sex** (ZZ chromosomes).

Sex determination is governed by the **dosage** of genes on the Z chromosome, most notably **DMRT1** (Doublesex and mab‑3 Related Transcription factor 1).

## Key Genetic Players

### DMRT1
- Located on the Z chromosome; there is no homologous copy on the W chromosome.
- **Dosage hypothesis:** ZZ males have two copies of *DMRT1*, while ZW females have only one copy. The higher expression of DMRT1 in ZZ gonads promotes testicular development.
- **Function:** DMRT1 is a transcription factor that activates male‑specific genes and represses female‑specific pathways. It is essential for testis differentiation and maintenance.

### The W Chromosome
- Carries female‑specific genes that may counteract male‑promoting signals.
- **ASW** (Avian Sex‑specific W) and **FET1** are candidate genes that might contribute to ovarian development, although their precise roles are still under investigation.

## Hormonal Control of Sexual Differentiation

Unlike mammals, where testicular hormones actively masculinize the embryo, avian sexual differentiation is largely **cell‑autonomous**. The gonad itself differentiates according to its chromosomal constitution, and hormones subsequently modulate the development of secondary sexual characteristics.

### Estrogens
- Produced by the ovary after differentiation.
- **Action:** Essential for the development of the female reproductive tract (oviduct) and external features (plumage, comb size in some species).

### Androgens
- Produced by the testis.
- **Action:** Promote male‑typical behaviors, song‑system development, and male secondary sexual traits.

## Comparison with Mammalian XY System

| Feature | Mammals (XY) | Birds (ZW) |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Heterogametic sex** | Male (XY) | Female (ZW) |
| **Sex‑determining gene** | SRY (on Y) | DMRT1 (dosage on Z) |
| **Gonadal differentiation driver** | SRY → SOX9 → testis | High DMRT1 → testis; low DMRT1 → ovary |
| **Role of hormones** | Active masculinization of ducts and external genitalia | Primarily secondary sexual characteristics |
| **Default pathway** | Female (XX) | Male (ZZ) |

## Summary
Avian sex determination illustrates a **dosage‑sensitive** mechanism where the number of Z‑linked *DMRT1* copies directs the bipotential gonad toward testis (ZZ) or ovary (ZW). The system highlights how different vertebrates have evolved distinct genetic solutions to the same fundamental problem of sexual differentiation.
